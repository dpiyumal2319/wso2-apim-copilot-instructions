## Habits and Best Practices
* Read the attached documents and follow the imports to discover more files and search with those files to discover relevant methods before implementing anything.


## Coding principles and Guidelines
* Add logs where ever necessary. When adding debug logs follow the existing procedure (log.isDebugEnabled()).
* Write javadoc comments for all public methods and classes.
* Follow existing coding conventions and styles.
* Use JAVA 11 features and libraries wherever possible.
* Use java design patterns and est practices wherever applicable.

## Project files
* TODO.md is not for you. It's for me.
